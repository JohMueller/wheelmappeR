The wheelmappeR package is a wrapper for the wheelmap.org API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wheelmappeR from GitHub with:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
## Make API call for a specific region
get_wheelmap_locations(api_key = api_key, bbox="52.35, 52.67, 13.22, 13.54")

```
